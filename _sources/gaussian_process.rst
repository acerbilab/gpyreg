Gaussian processes
==================
---------------------------
``gpyreg.gaussian_process``
---------------------------

This module contains the ``GP`` class, which is the main entry point for working with Gaussian processes. A class instance is initialized with specified dimension and covariance/mean/noise functions. Then, its various methods can be used to fit data, make predictions, plot the GP, etc.
