Release notes
=============

1.2.0 (2026-09-13)
------------------

* :meth:`gpyreg.GP.predict` accepts the keyword-only option
  ``return_cross_covariance=True``. It appends a tuple containing the latent
  training-to-prediction kernel matrix for each hyperparameter sample.
  Downstream calculations can reuse these matrices instead of computing
  them again. Ordinary calls retain their existing return values.
* Kernel matrices remain separate when predictions are averaged across
  hyperparameter samples. They exclude observation noise and are
  unconditioned kernels, rather than posterior predictive covariances.
  Prior-only GPs return ``None`` for each sample. See
  :doc:`gaussian_process` for examples, shapes and memory considerations.
* The prediction reference corrects the documented default of ``add_noise``
  to ``False`` and the averaged-output shape to ``(M, 1)``. These are
  documentation corrections; the corresponding behavior is unchanged.

1.1.0 (2026-09-05)
------------------

* :meth:`gpyreg.GP.fit`, :meth:`gpyreg.GP.random_function`,
  :class:`gpyreg.slice_sample.SliceSampler` and ``f_min_fill`` accept
  ``rng=``. Pass a NumPy generator to share a stream with the caller, or a
  seed to create a generator. The default ``rng=None`` continues to use
  NumPy's global stream controlled by ``np.random.seed``. See :doc:`rng`.
* Prediction and hyperparameter fitting have lower computational overhead,
  including batched evaluation of bundled mean functions and reuse of a
  factorization when only mean hyperparameters change during fitting.
  Custom mean and covariance implementations retain their supported paths.
* :meth:`gpyreg.GP.log_likelihood` and :meth:`gpyreg.GP.log_posterior`
  correctly return ``(value, gradient)`` when ``compute_grad=True``;
  these calls previously raised ``TypeError``.
* Slice samplers using the default stream remain copyable and picklable.
  Their saved state does not capture NumPy's global random state. Samplers
  with an explicit generator preserve its state when copied or pickled;
  older sampler saves resume using the global stream.
