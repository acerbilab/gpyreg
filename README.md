# GPyReg
### What is it?

Testing...

GPyReg is a lightweight package for Gaussian process regression in Python. It was developed for use with [PyVBMC](https://github.com/acerbilab/pyvbmc) (a Python package for efficient black-box Bayesian inference) but is usable as a standalone package.

### Documentation
The documentation is currently hosted on [github.io](https://acerbilab.github.io/gpyreg/).

## Installation
GPyReg is available via `pip` and `conda-forge`:
```console
python -m pip install gpyreg
```
or:
```console
conda install --channel=conda-forge gpyreg
```
GPyReg requires Python version 3.9 or newer.

## Troubleshooting and contact

If you have trouble doing something with GPyReg, spot bugs or strange behavior, or you simply have some questions, please feel free to:
- Post in the lab's [Discussions forum](https://github.com/orgs/acerbilab/discussions) with questions or comments about GPyReg, your problems & applications;
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/acerbilab/gpyreg/issues/new) on GitHub;
- Contact the project lead at <luigi.acerbi@helsinki.fi>, putting 'GPyReg' in the subject of the email.

You can also demonstrate your appreciation for GPyReg in the following ways:

- *Star :star:* the repository on GitHub;
- [Subscribe](http://eepurl.com/idcvc9) to the lab's newsletter for news and updates (new features, bug fixes, new releases, etc.);
- [Follow Luigi Acerbi on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AcerbiLuigi) for updates about our other projects;

If you are interested in applications of Gaussian process regression to Bayesian inference and optimization, you may also want to check out [PyVBMC](https://github.com/acerbilab/pyvbmc) for efficient black-box inference, and [Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search](https://github.com/acerbilab/bads) (BADS), our method for fast Bayesian optimization. BADS is currently available only in MATLAB, but a Python version will be released soon.
